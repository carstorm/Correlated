# Correlated
*Storage and automation for the modern world.*

*Note:* The mod used to be hosted on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/correlated-potentialistics).


Correlated is a minimalistic Applied Energistics-like mod for 1.9 and later What this means, is that it adds a storage system based around digitizing items, allowing you to store tons of items in a small space that are conveniently accessible, through a single scrollable/searchable GUI.

This mod is intended to be used alongside a mod like [JustEnoughItems](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/just-enough-items-jei), as there is no recipe guide.

This mod does NOT include a way to generate RF. You will need another mod that generates RF such as [Progressive Automation](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/progressive-automation-early-miner) or [BuildCraft](http://www.mod-buildcraft.com).

### Quick Primer for people familiar with AE2
*Storage math is basically identical to AE2.
*There are no cables, contact is the only way to make a network work.
*You need a controller. There are no adhoc networks.
*There's no Cell Workbench, instead just right-click a drive you're holding to configure it.
*Priority is configured per-drive rather than per-drive bay.
*What AE2 calls a "Drive" I call a "Drive Bay", what they call a "Cell" I call a "Drive".
*Processors are found in dungeon/stronghold/nether fortress/jungle temple chests.
